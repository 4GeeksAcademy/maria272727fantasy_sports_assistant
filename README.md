###Fantasy Sports Performance Prediction Model
####Project Description
This project aims to develop a predictive model that forecasts player performance in fantasy sports over multiple weeks. The model takes into account historical performance data, player statistics, and various other factors to generate accurate predictions for fantasy sports enthusiasts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model helps users make informed decisions when setting their fantasy sports lineups, improving their chances of success in weekly matchups.
